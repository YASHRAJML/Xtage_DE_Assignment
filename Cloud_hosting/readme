AWS Data Pipeline Deployment Plan::


Services Utilized:
•	AWS S3: Store raw CSV and JSON files.
•	AWS Lambda: Ingest and process data.
•	AWS Glue: Transform and prepare data.
•	AWS RDS (PostgreSQL): Store and query structured data.
•	AWS API Gateway: Expose and manage APIs.
•	AWS CloudFormation/Terraform: Automate infrastructure deployment.


1. Data Ingestion:
  CSV Files (e.g., sales_data.csv, products.csv):
  Store in S3, then use Lambda or Glue jobs to ingest into RDS (PostgreSQL).
  JSON Files (e.g., exchange_rates.json, customer_data.json):
  Store in S3, then use Lambda or Glue for ingestion.
  APIs:
  Use Lambda triggered by API Gateway to fetch and process data, storing results in S3 or RDS.
2. Data Processing:
  AWS Lambda: Triggered by S3 events or API Gateway for lightweight processing.
  AWS Glue: Perform complex ETL tasks, standardize formats, and transform data.

3. Data Storage:
•	Amazon Redshift: Use as a data warehouse for processed datasets.

4. Data Serving:
•	AWS API Gateway: Expose APIs for external/internal access.
•	AWS Lambda: Handle API requests and serve processed data.

5. Orchestration:
•	AWS Step Functions: Coordinate and manage the entire data pipeline.

6. Monitoring and Logging:
•	Amazon CloudWatch: Monitor pipeline, set up alerts.
•	AWS CloudTrail: Enable audit logging.

Implementation Steps:
1.	Setup AWS S3:
  Create an S3 bucket (xtage-data-pipeline) to store the CSV and JSON files.
2.	Implement AWS Lambda Functions:
  CSV Ingestion: Read CSV files from S3 and load them into RDS.
  JSON Ingestion: Read JSON files from S3 and load them into RDS.
3.	Set Up AWS RDS (PostgreSQL):
  Create tables matching the data schema from the provided files (e.g., sales, products, transactions, exchange_rates, customers).
4.	Develop and Deploy AWS Glue Jobs:
  Convert JSON to a tabular format.
  Perform data transformations and standardization.
  Combine data from different sources into a unified dataset.
5.	Deploy the Pipeline Using CloudFormation/Terraform:
  Automate the deployment of all resources, including S3, Lambda, RDS, and Glue.
