Here is a rewritten version of the AWS Data Pipeline Deployment Plan in a polished and organized format:

AWS Data Pipeline Deployment Plan

Services Utilized:

AWS S3: Store raw CSV and JSON files
AWS Lambda: Ingest and process data
AWS Glue: Transform and prepare data
AWS RDS (PostgreSQL): Store and query structured data
AWS API Gateway: Expose and manage APIs
AWS CloudFormation/Terraform: Automate infrastructure deployment
Data Pipeline Overview:

  1. Data Ingestion
Store CSV files (e.g., sales_data.csv, products.csv) in S3 and ingest into RDS using Lambda or Glue jobs
Store JSON files (e.g., exchange_rates.json, customer_data.json) in S3 and ingest using Lambda or Glue
Use Lambda triggered by API Gateway to fetch and process API data, storing results in S3 or RDS
  2. Data Processing
Use AWS Lambda for lightweight processing, triggered by S3 events or API Gateway
Use AWS Glue for complex ETL tasks, standardizing formats, and transforming data
  3. Data Storage
Use Amazon Redshift as a data warehouse for processed datasets
  4. Data Serving
Use AWS API Gateway to expose APIs for external/internal access
Use AWS Lambda to handle API requests and serve processed data
  5. Orchestration
Use AWS Step Functions to coordinate and manage the entire data pipeline
  6. Monitoring and Logging
Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor pipeline and set up alerts
Use AWS CloudTrail to enable audit logging


Implementation Roadmap:

Setup AWS S3: Create an S3 bucket (xtage-data-pipeline) to store CSV and JSON files
Implement AWS Lambda Functions:
  CSV Ingestion: Read CSV files from S3 and load into RDS
  JSON Ingestion: Read JSON files from S3 and load into RDS
Set Up AWS RDS (PostgreSQL): Create tables matching the data schema from the provided files (e.g., sales, products, transactions, exchange_rates, customers)
Develop and Deploy AWS Glue Jobs:
  Convert JSON to a tabular format
  Perform data transformations and standardization
  Combine data from different sources into a unified dataset 
  Deploy the Pipeline Using CloudFormation/Terraform: Automate the deployment of all resources, including S3, Lambda, RDS, and Glue
